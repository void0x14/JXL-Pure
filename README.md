## ✨ Key Features

-   **🎯 100% Mathematically Lossless:** Uses `-d 0` and `--lossless_jpeg=1` to ensure bit-for-bit accuracy.
-   **🚀 Lightning Fast Discovery:** Powered by `fd-find` for near-instant file scanning even on 1TB+ drives.
-   **💾 Massive Space Savings:** Save up to 50% storage space while keeping your memories in state-of-the-art JPEG XL format.
-   **🔄 Resumable Logic:** Interrupted? No problem. The script automatically skips already converted files.
-   **⚙️ Flexible Effort Levels:** Choose between "I need it now" (Effort 1) and "I want the smallest file" (Effort 9).
-   **🛡️ Safety First:** Optional `--delete-originals` only triggers after a verified successful conversion.
-   **🐧 Universal Linux Support:** Native scripts for both **Bash** and **Fish Shell**.
